## Go: Getting Started - PluralSight Course

This repository contents the source files that I created while taking the course.

In this repository you will not find any test, only simple files to learn the basics.

I hope to increase my knowledge of Golang and be able to create future code using TDD.

The content of each file is not original I just followed the instructions.
