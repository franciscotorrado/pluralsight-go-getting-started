## Go: Getting Started - PluralSight Course

This repository contents the source files that I created while taking the course.

In this repository you will not find any test with golang tools, only simple files to learn the basics.

I hope to increase my knowledge of Golang and be able to create future code using TDD.

The content of each file is not original I just followed the instructions.

#### Build and run

##### build exe file
`go build . `

##### run webservice without build
`go run MyModules/DemoModule1Test/webservice` 

_Finally, I add to the repository a collection of Postman tests. I know the current folder is not in best place and should look for information about good folder structure in Go projects._
I suppose that src and tests folders may have a common root and exclude tests folders from build.

The current project has no errors control and log.
